# Contribution Guidelines
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Search included workflows before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Every workflow addition should follow the same format:
	1. The workflow should be put into its appropriate category (Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure).
	2. Omit `Alfred` in workflow name if possible.
	3. End all descriptions with a full stop.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- You can also add other related websites and repositories in the end.
