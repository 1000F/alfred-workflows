# Contribution Guidelines
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Search included workflows before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Every workflow addition should follow the same format.
	1. The workflow should be put into its appropriate category (Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure).
	2. The name of the workflow is added with `###` level heading (with Alfred omitted from the name).
	3. Add `> ` quote below and quickly describe the workflow.
- Only `essential` workflows can have an Image or GIF to showcase the workflow. What is essential is subjective but we still want to keep it as a category.
- End all descriptions with a full stop.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
