# Contribution Guidelines
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Search included workflows before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Every workflow addition should follow the same format.
	1. The workflow should be put into its appropriate category (Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure).
	2. The name of the workflow is added with `###` level heading (with Alfred omitted from the name).
	3. Add `> ` quote below and quickly describe the workflow.
- End all descriptions with a full stop.
- Only `essential` workflows can have an Image or GIF to showcase the workflow. What is essential is subjective but we still want to keep it as a category.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- If you are unsure about anything, feel free to [open up an issue](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows/issues/new) and we will help you.
- If you want to add to [related websites or repositories](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows#related-websites--repositories), give a description of the website/repo where possible.
