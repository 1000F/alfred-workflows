# Contribution Guidelines
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Use the following format: `[Workflow name](link) - Description.`
- The workflow should be put into its appropriate category (Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure).
- Omit `Alfred` in workflow name as it is implied.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the workflow and why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorisation are welcome.
- If you submit a workflow that is similar to an existing workflow in the list, argument how it's better.
